# Assumptions in terms of priority

We first sort out the dangerous potholes first, then we sort by age (to avoid lower priority potholes being forgotten), and finally by street priority

We only use the age as a tiebreaker for potholes that are of the same priority

- Priority 1: Autoroute, Boulevard, Promenade

- Priority 2: Avenue, Route, Rue, Chemin, Corridor

- Priority 3: Montée, Place, Ruelle, Impasse, Allée, Croissant
