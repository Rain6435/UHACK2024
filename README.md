## Project description

The project's goal was to help find a solution for the city of Gatineau to find and repair potholes as quickly as possible. The city has two ways to signal a pothole: either call the city or fill out a form online. We created an application that allows citizens to report a pothole directly in a user-friendly way, from their phones, and track the progress of the repair.
