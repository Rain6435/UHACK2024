# UHACK 2024

This project was our submission to the hackathon at the University of Quebec in Outaouais in 2024.

## Project description

The project's goal was to help find a solution for the city of Gatineau to find and repair potholes as quickly as possible. The city has two ways to signal a pothole: either call the city or fill out a form online. We created an application that allows citizens to report a pothole directly in a user-friendly way, from their phones, and track the progress of the repair.

This database is designed to manage service requests, the teams handling them, and the individuals submitting them.

The key tables are:
*request: Stores service request details like location, status, priority, and assigned team.
*requestor: Contains information about the people submitting the requests (name, contact info, etc.).
*team: Represents the teams responsible for handling requests, including their work schedules and work regions.
